Hello Networking World!
This is my IP Generator:
  A tool to generate IP addresses by incrementing each Octet or Quad of your specified range and quantity. [166.30.30.2 or 10.2.255.254, ex.]
  Give the first IP address in your range and the number of ip's to generate.

This script will output 12 digits. See alternate script that outputs address without leading zeros.
